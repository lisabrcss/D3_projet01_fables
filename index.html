  <h2>The boy and his mother</h2>

  <div class="main-content">
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>A little Boy having stolen a book from one of his school-fellows, took it to his Mother, who, instead of correcting him, praised his sharpness, and rewarded him. In process of time, as he grew bigger, he increased also in villainy, till at length he was taken up for committing a great robbery, and was brought to justice and condemned for it. As the officers were conducting him to the gallows, he was attended by a vast crowd, and among the rest his Mother came sobbing along, and deploring her son’s unhappy fate; which the criminal observing, he begged leave to speak to her: this being granted, he put his mouth to her ear, as if he was going to whisper something, and bit it off! The officer, shocked at this behaviour, asked him if the crimes he had committed were not sufficient to glut his wickedness, without being also guilty of such an unnatural violence towards his mother? Let no one wonder, said he, that I have done this to her, for she deserves even worse at my hands. For if she had chastised instead of praising and encouraging me, when I stole my school-fellow’s book, I should not now have been brought to this ignominious and untimely end.</p>

  <h2>The brother and the sister</h2>

<div class="text-content">
  <p>A certain man had two children, a Son and a Daughter; the Boy very handsome, and the Girl only moderately so. They were both young, and happened to be one day playing near the looking-glass, which stood on their mother’s toilet. The Boy, pleased with the novelty of the thing, viewed himself for some time, and in a wanton roguish manner, observed to the Girl how handsome he was. She resented it, and could not bear the insolent manner in which he spoke, for she understood it (as how could she do otherwise) to be intended as a direct affront to her. Therefore she ran immediately to her Father, and with a deal of aggravation, complained of her Brother, particularly of his having acted so effeminate a part as to look in a glass, and meddle with things which belonged to women only. The father embraced them both with much tenderness and affection, and told them that he should like to have them look in a glass every day: to the intent that you, says he, addressing himself to the Boy, if you think that face of yours handsome, may not disgrace and spoil it by an ugly temper, and a foul behaviour; and that you, speaking to the girl, may make up for the defects of your person, if there be any, by the sweetness of your manners, and the agreeableness of your conversation.</p>

  <h2>The young men and the cook</h2>

  <div class="main-content">
  <p>Two Young Men went into a Cook’s shop, under pretence of buying some meat; and while the Cook’s back was turned, one of them snatched up a piece of beef, and gave it to his companion, who clapt it under his cloak. The Cook turning about, and missing his beef, began to charge them with it: upon which he that first took it swore bitterly he had none of it. He that had it, swore as heartily that he had not taken it. Why, look ye, gentlemen, says the Cook, I see your equivocation; and though I cannot tell which of you has taken my meat, I am sure between you there is a thief."</p>
